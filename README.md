# Voice Digit Recognition

Use the HTK toolkit to train a model to recognize the spoken numbers.


# Usage

Installation of HTK toolkit differs a lot on every platform. The project comes with a `Vagrantfile` in order to ease the project's setup. Vagrant will provision a virtual machine containing Ubuntu 32bit and also install HTK. Refers to [Vagrant's documentation](https://www.vagrantup.com/) for more details.

```
# Init the VM
vagrant up
vagrant ss
cd /vagrant

# Train the model and display the result against the dev training set
./start-htk.sh
```
